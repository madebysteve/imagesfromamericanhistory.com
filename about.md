## The Site

Images from American History will mine the artistic and visual culture of the United States for paintings, photographs, and other objects that shed light on the lives of those who have lived here, and on the changing identity of the nation. Undoubtedly it will reflect my interests in fashion, vernacular (folk) art, and issues of gender, race, class, and sexuality. So, if you’re looking to read about Civil War artillery, this probably isn’t for you. If you’re looking to read about snapshots and pantaloons, you’re in the right place.

The word “image” can connote something immaterial, but that isn’t my intention with the title of this blog. Rather, the choice of “image” instead of “object” is meant to emphasize the visual/art-historical focus of the entries.

Happy reading!

- I employ the term “American” self-consciously, with the awareness that for many people it refers more broadly to the Americas as a whole. If “United Statesian” sounded less awkward, I would use that instead.
