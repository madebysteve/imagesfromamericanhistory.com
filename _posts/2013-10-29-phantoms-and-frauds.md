Dear Readers,

Interested in knowing what this picture is all about?

In addition to my usual post this month, I also authored an essay on spirit photography for _OUPblog: Oxford University Pressâ€™s Academic Insights for the Thinking World_. You can find it [here](http://blog.oup.com/2013/10/history-spirit-photography/). Enjoy!
